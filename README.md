Hey :) 

DESCRIPTION:
	So this is sort of a visual music player, using a javascript library called p5.js. I wanted to create something more visual than based in data because I've been thinking about ways to visualize music a lot, especially with attempting to show cool album art more prominently. When the project is first opened the first song of the search plays (the search is set at Tame Impala right now, but can be changed) and you can see the album art and an interactive sketch. With clicking the mouse each time, the album art of the next song in the search and a different sketch replaces the previous song. I chose to only loop through the first five songs in the search to save space and to use as a trial for the idea. Overall, my goal was to make listening to music a little bit more of an interactive and visual experience, in addition to already being an audio experience. 

FUTURE MODIFICATIONS:
	In the future I'd love to make this into a full music player, instead of playing just the first song in the search. It would be cool to have the backgroud change based on the amplitude and frequency of the specific song, and I think that would be the next step for sure. I would also try to use the colors of the album art in the background sketches, using some sort of color picker. 

TO RUN: 
	In the folder, open index.html in Firefox specifically. I had a lot of trouble getting certian parts of the Soundcloud API to work in Chrome because of all of it's blocks, specifically with streaming and with the image function in p5.js, so I decided to make it just for Firefox for now. 

Thank you for looking at my project, it was pretty fun to make!
